# what is the useMemo and useCallback and what is the differece

`useMemo` and `useCallback` are both hooks in React used to optimize performance by memoizing values and functions respectively.

**useMemo:**

- `useMemo` is used to memoize the result of a function so that it is only recalculated when its dependencies change.
- It takes a function and an array of dependencies, and returns the memoized value of that function.
- Example:

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react";

function MyComponent({ a, b }) {
  const result = useMemo(() => {
    return a + b;
  }, [a, b]);

  return <div>{result}</div>;
}
```

**useCallback:**

- `useCallback` is used to memoize a function so that it is only recreated when its dependencies change.
- It takes a function and an array of dependencies, and returns a memoized version of that function.
- Example:

```jsx
import React, { useCallback } from "react";

function MyComponent({ onClick }) {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onClick();
  }, [onClick]);

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

**Comparison:**

- `useMemo` is used to memoize values, while `useCallback` is used to memoize functions.
- `useMemo` is useful when you want to memoize the result of a complex computation, while `useCallback` is useful when you want to memoize a callback function to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
