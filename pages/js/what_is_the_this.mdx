# what is the this in the OPP

keyword refer to the object that currently excuting in the code.
it's basically represent the context in which thee code is being excuted

1. <b>Global Context</b> when used in the gloabl scope (outside of any function)
   , `this` refer to the global object{" "}
1. <b>Inside Function</b> value of `this` inside regural function is how the function
   is called If the function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to
   the object itself. Otherwise, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`, and in non-strict
   mode, it refers to the global object.

   ```javascript
   function myFunction() {
     console.log(this);
   }

   const obj = {
     myMethod: myFunction,
   };

   obj.myMethod(); // `this` refers to `obj`

   myFunction(); // `this` depends on strict mode or not
   ```


1. <b>Constructor function</b>  Inside a constructor function (a function used with the `new` keyword), `this` refers to the newly created instance of the object.
  
  
   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
       console.log(this);
   }

   const person1 = new Person('Alice'); // `this` refers to `person1`
   ```


1. <b>Call, Apply, and Bind Methods</b>  
These methods allow you to specify the value of `this` explicitly when calling a function.


  ```javascript
   function greet() {
       console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
   }

   const obj = { name: 'Alice' };
   greet.call(obj); // `this` refers to `obj`
   greet.apply(obj); // `this` refers to `obj`

   const boundGreet = greet.bind(obj);
   boundGreet(); // `this` refers to `obj`
   ```
5. **Arrow Functions**: Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. Instead, they inherit `this` from the enclosing lexical context.

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
       name: 'Alice',
       greet: () => {
           console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
       }
   };

   obj.greet(); // `this` refers to the enclosing lexical context (usually the global object)
   ```
