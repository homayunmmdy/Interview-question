# Differece between arrow function and reguralr function 

1. **Regular Function**:
   - Has its own `this` context, which is determined by how the function is called.
   - Suitable for methods or constructors where `this` needs to be dynamic.

2. **Arrow Function**:
   - Inherits `this` from the enclosing lexical context (the context where the arrow function is defined).
   - Great for maintaining the outer `this` context, like in callbacks or when you want to access `this` from the parent scope without it being altered.
