# Here are list of the common question that the chance of asking theme is very high

## 1.What is the difference between let and var

You can list out the differences in a tabular format

| var                                                            | let                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| It has been available from the beginning of JavaScript         | Introduced as part of ES6                               |
| It has function scope                                          | It has block scope                                      |
| (available throughout the function in which they're declared.) | (only accessible with in the block like {} the declare) |
| Variable declaration will be hoisted                           | Hoisted but not initialized                             |
| It is possible to re-declare the variable in the same scope    | It is not possible to re-declare the variable           |

Let's take an example to see the difference,

```JavaScript
function userDetails(username) {
  if (username) {
    console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
    console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
    let age = 30;
    var salary = 10000;
  }
  console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible due to function scope)
  console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}
userDetails("John");
```

## 2. What is the Hoisting

behavior where variables and functions declarations are moved to the top of their containig scope during compile phase,
before the code executed.

```JavaScript
console.log(myVar) // undefined
var myVar = 10
console.log(myVar) // 10

// Function declaration: STARTS with `function` keyword
myFun() // Hi
function myFun() {
    console.log('Hi')
}
// Function expression: DOES NOT START with `function` keyword
mySum() // ReferenceError: mySum is not defined
const mySum = (function sumB(a, b) {
  return a + b;
});

```

<b>function declaration</b>Are hoisted entirely so they can be called before
they define
<b>function expression</b>Are not hoisted
<b>Var</b> Are Hoisted but not theri initialization this is why show undefined
<b>let or const</b> Are Hoisted but not theri initialized casuing a `ReferenceError`

## 3. What is the difference between Reference type and primitive type

primitive type
they save the value and save the data and dat won't change

```javascript
let num = 5
let str = 'Hi'
let bool = true
let und = undefined (used when we don't decalre value for variable)
let nul = null (set some value to zero or nothing)
```

Reference type
they save the address and their value is change
let arr = [1,2,3]
let obj = {name : "alice" , age: 22}
let func = functions() {console.log('hi')}

## 4. Differece between arrow function and reguralr function

1. **Regular Function**:

   - Has its own `this` context, which is determined by how the function is called.
   - Suitable for methods or constructors where `this` needs to be dynamic.

2. **Arrow Function**:
   - Inherits `this` from the enclosing lexical context (the context where the arrow function is defined).
   - Great for maintaining the outer `this` context, like in callbacks or when you want to access `this` from the parent scope without it being altered.

## 4. How does the `this` keyword work in different content? `this` refer to different object depened on context

```javascript
console.log(this); //Global context(window in browser)

function showThis() {
    console.log(this) // Globale context in non-strict mode , undefined in strict mode
}

const obj = {
    method: fnction() {
        console.log(this) //Refers to obj
    }
}

obj.method();
```

## 5. Differece Between Synchronous and Asynchronous which of theme is javascript 

- <b>Synchronous</b> code executed squentially one taskk at time each operation waits for previous one to complete also 
javascript use that

- Reading a file line by line

- <b>Asynchronous</b> Code excuted without waiting for previous operations to complete, allowing multiple task to run 
concurrenlty 

- Making an API call while continuing to excute other code.
