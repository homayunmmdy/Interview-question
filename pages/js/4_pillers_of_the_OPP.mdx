## 4 pillers of the OPP 


<ul>
<ol><b>Encapsulation:</b> A collection of the data and function in the class</ol>
like this car exmaple we put all varibales like model color speed engine and functionality or method like start stop we pu 
in one class that we called car 
<ol><b>Abstraction:</b> A way to hide the details and and just show the functionality</ol>
like remote control you just press the next button and you don't know what happend how it's send signall and it's to change tv services
you just click to change 
<ol><b>Inhertitance :</b> Inherit the attribute and methods of the class </ol>
like behavior you inherit the behavior of your mother and father when we inherti 2 thing in one we called multy inherit
<ol><b>Encapsulation:</b> ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. </ol>
like we have animal class and we Encapsulation to call of cat we and we rewrite some variables or method or add new features 
in inheritance we get copy of class but in Encapsulation we get copy and modifiy that too 
</ul>
