# Explain generics in TypeScript 

Generics are able to create a component or function to work over a variety of types rather than a single one.

```
class Queue<T> {
  private data = [];
  push = (item: T) => this.data.push(item);
  pop = (): T => this.data.shift();
}

const queue = new Queue<number>();
queue.push(0);
queue.push("1"); // ERROR : cannot push a string. Only numbers allowed
```
